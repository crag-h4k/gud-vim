# Gud Vim

This is a pretty good vim setup.


## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/deadlift1226/gud-vim.git --recursive
ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc

```

The only external dependancy (that I can think of right now) is jedi, which can be install via apt or pip as follows:

```bash

sudo pip install jedi
```

or

```bash
sudo apt install python3-jedi
```
